# Google-Authentication--NodeJs
In this project we simply use the passport google Strategy. Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application.
A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

## Configure Strategy
The Google authentication strategy authenticates users using a Google account and OAuth 2.0 tokens. The client ID and secret obtained when creating an application are supplied as options when creating the strategy.

# Google Credentials
you must register an application with Google. If you have not already done so, a new project can be created in the[Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com/). Your application will be issued a client ID and client secret, which need to be provided to the strategy. You will also need to configure a redirect URI which matches the route in your application.
